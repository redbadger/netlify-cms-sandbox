I create this web app using:

- Next
- Netlify CMS

This content was created via Netlify CMS and is stored via version control integration between GitHub and Netlify.

In terms of auth for CMS for content creators you can do integrations with:

- Azure (Active directory)
- GitHub
- GitLab

Or customise your own backend to this

Let's catch on Monday and I will show you.

Best

Pedro
